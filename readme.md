## About This Repository

I'm continuing my #100DaysOfCode challenge with the **"React - The Complete Guide 2025"** structured and themed mini-projects. Each assignment is meticulously documented in its own folder named `assignment-xx`, corresponding to each exercise in the course. 

Meanwhile, I implemented the first 26 tasks into my **FinPanel project**, and I will continue conventionally numbering my social media posts about my progress with the assignments as I started with #100DaysOfCode.

This repository is designed to provide recruiters, hiring managers, and fellow developers with a clear view of my learning journey, practical application of concepts, and proficiency in modern React development.
